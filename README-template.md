## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS custom properties.
- Flexbox.
- CSS Grid.
- Mobile-first workflow.

### What I learned

|I learned how to use "grid" a litle more.
|I learned how to make a "box-shadow" properly.
|I still learning how to make a layout with landmarks and best practices. 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<!--I'm proud of me to make all the layout by myself, this part of code is easy, but it was litle bit more dificult than all the code html-->
<img class="music"src="images/icon-music.svg" alt=""><p><span class="bold">Annual Plan</span><br>$59.99/year</p>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css{
} 
/*Definitely these were the most challeging CSS codes, IÂ´ve spent a lot of time solving those codes*/
    button{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    width: 325px;
    height: 2.75rem;
    font-weight: 700;
    color: white;
    background-color: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
    font-family: "Red hat display";
    border: 0;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0px 18px 15px 1px rgba(220, 216, 248,1);
    cursor: pointer;
    }

    body{
    background-image: url(images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: 100% 45vh;
    background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: "Red hat display";
    display: grid;
    place-content: center;}
```
